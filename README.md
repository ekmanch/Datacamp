## Course 1: Data Scientist Professional with Python

Master the skills you need to pass the Data Scientist Professional with Python certification and prepare yourself for success in the field of data science.

Throughout this track, you will focus on using Python for data science, starting with the basics and progressing to more advanced topics such as machine learning. You’ll cover a broad range of areas, including data manipulation, visualization, and analysis, using popular Python libraries such as pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn.

As you progress, you’ll work through interactive exercises using real-world datasets to help you test your abilities and develop your skills. These examples will help you explore various statistical and machine learning techniques, including hypothesis testing and predictive modeling. You’ll also gain an understanding of package development, data preprocessing, SQL for relational databases, Git for data science projects, and more.

Complete this track to gain the knowledge and experience necessary to confidently pass the Data Scientist Professional with Python certification and thrive as a data scientist.

## Course 2: Data Analyst in SQL

Database design is critical for a high-performance application. Just like you wouldn't build a house without a blueprint, you need to plan how you’ll store your data beforehand. In this interactive SQL track, you'll learn the fundamentals of database design and how to:

✓ Write basic SQL queries

✓ Group and aggregate data to produce summary statistics

✓ Join tables and apply filters and sub-queries

✓ Write functions to explore and manipulate data

Working with real-world datasets, gain the SQL skills you need to query a database, analyze results, and effectively communicate your insights to stakeholders. There’s no prior SQL knowledge required—start your journey to becoming a confident data analyst.
